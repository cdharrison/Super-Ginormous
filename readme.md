# Super Ginormous for Tersus

An achingly simple child theme for [Tersus](http://tersustheme.com/).


## About

Tersus is an exercise in publishing template minimalism.

By removing the majority of the presentational markup and other cruft from the [Tersus](http://tersustheme.com/) parent theme, weâ€™ve opened the door for child themes to pick up the aesthetic slack. There are currently two child themes being developed for Tersus.

Keep track of Tersus development on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/tersustheme).
